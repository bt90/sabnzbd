Release Notes - SABnzbd 4.1.0
=========================================================

## Changes since 4.0.3
- Added a dark mode for the Config, Login, and Wizard pages.
- Added multi-select to the History.
- Show the number of items in post-processing when in Tabbed mode.
- Added option `verify_xff_header` to include `X-Forwarded-For` when
  validating if connections should be accepted when using a proxy.
- Added option to purge log files from the Folders Config page.
- Moved `Server IP address selection` and `On failure, try
  alternative NZB` to Special settings.
- Special setting `ipv6_servers` changed to on/off.
- Only use 7zip to unpack `.zip` files.
- Windows: Added option `enable_multipar` to use par2cmdline-turbo

- Windows: Use `All Users` locations during installation of shortcuts.
